= Scrub UUIDs

The `UuidScrubber` replaces all UUID found in a string by a simpler string.

It also ensures that if the same UUID is found multiple times in the same string the same replacement string is used.

== Examples

[%unbreakable]
[source,php]
----
include::UuidScrubberTest.php[tag=removes_uuids_from_string_code]
----

produces

[%unbreakable]
----
include::__snapshots__/UuidScrubberTest__removes_uuids_from_a_string__1.txt[]
----

The following example shows that multiple occurrences of the same UUID are replaced with the same value :

[%unbreakable]
[source,php]
----
include::UuidScrubberTest.php[tag=reuses_id_for_a_uuid_found_multiple_times]
----

produces

[%unbreakable]
----
include::__snapshots__/UuidScrubberTest__reuses_id_for_a_uuid_found_multiple_times__1.txt[]
